# Dream outline of the project 

Building up in complexity of the system: 

## One cell internal
1. One cell case of Hes oscillations. Show the necessity to have delay in the Hes oscillations, otherwise it converges to a fixed stable state, we need the Hopf bifurcation 

## Isolated cell interactions
Goal is to find parameters to constrain the later more complex systems with to get desirable properties. 

2. Isolated coupling between two cells (handle the stability case of two cells without Hes dynamics, only Delta) --> link to results from the 2 cell case without any delay in Hes. Vary p_d and hill coefficient in the coupling n. Do we see the states that the cells remain in the same state.
3. Use a single cell with Hes dynamics in a bath of Delta to see what the behaviour of the Hes dynamics are with in practice a steady source term in the mRNA differential equation.
4. Investigate a fully function 2 cell system, so including Hes dynamics, to see under which parameters this system in synchronised an when it laterally inhibits. Also, to see if it plays a role in synchronising the system. (or do small pertubations cause a lateral inhibition to occur very fast). 
    - Look at effects of n and pd
    - Look at effects of delay on oscillations of this system 

    Measure: when lateral inhibition, behaviour before lateral inhibition

5. See if the fully function 2 cell system works synchronisingly or not. 

## 1D system of cells 

6. Look at decay, period, amplitude, mean expression level and lateral inhibition of system (undelayed in coupling)
7. Look at the effects on these observables with the addition of a uniform delay in the system 
8.
